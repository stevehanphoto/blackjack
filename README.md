# Steve Han Photography Blackjack Game

This game was my final project for the class, [CNIT 133: JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX](https://ccsf.edu/Schedule/CD/CNIT%20133.htm), I took at CCSF Spring of 2019.  The game was made using vanilla javascript, HTML, and CSS.

There are 4 front card faces, using images of my days as a fashion photographer, of each of 4 suits in a 52 deck card.  At the end of the semester we gave presentation of our project.  [Click here]() to view my presentation, made using [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/).
