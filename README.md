# Steve Han Photography Blackjack Game

This game was my final project for an introduction to javascript class, [CNIT 133: JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX](https://ccsf.edu/Schedule/CD/CNIT%20133.htm), that I took at CCSF Spring of 2019.  The game was made using vanilla javascript, HTML, and CSS.

There are four front card faces using images from my days as a fashion photographer to represent the four suits in a 52 deck card.

At the end of the semester we gave presentation of our project.  [View my presentation slides](https://cocky-benz-f77e67.netlify.app/presentation/final.html), made using [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/).
